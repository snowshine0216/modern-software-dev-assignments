# [FEATURE] Design Document

## Current Context
- Brief overview of the existing system
- Key components and their relationships
- Pain points or gaps being addressed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- List of must-have functionality
- Expected behaviors
- Integration points

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Scalability needs
- Observability requirements
- Security considerations

## Design Decisions

### 1. [Major Decision Area]
Will implement/choose [approach] because:
- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Trade-offs considered

### 2. [Another Decision Area]
Will implement/choose [approach] because:
- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Alternatives considered

## Technical Design
If relevant, specify the following:
### 1. Core Components
```python
# Key interfaces/classes with type hints
class MainComponent:
    """Core documentation"""
    pass
```

### 2. Data Models
```python
# Key data models with type hints
class DataModel:
    """Model documentation"""
    pass
```

### 3. Integration Points
- How this interfaces with other systems
- API contracts
- Data flow diagrams if needed

### 4. Files Changes
- Explicitly mention which files will be impacted/created in this change.
- These should be the ONLY files impacted in the change.

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: [Initial Implementation]
   - Task 1
